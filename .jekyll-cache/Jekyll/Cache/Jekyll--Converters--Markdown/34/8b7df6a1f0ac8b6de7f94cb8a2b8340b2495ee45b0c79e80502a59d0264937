<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>The Machine Learning community is currently experiencing a
<a href="https://neuripsconf.medium.com/designing-the-reproducibility-program-for-neurips-2020-7fcccaa5c6ad">reproducibility crisis</a>
and a reviewing crisis <a href="#Litt">[Littman, 2021]</a>. Because of the highly competitive and noisy
reviewing process of ML conferences¬†<a href="#Tran">[Tran et al., 2020]</a>, researchers have an incentive to
oversell their results, slowing down the progress and diminishing the
integrity of the scientific community. Moreover with the growing number
of papers published and submitted at the main ML conferences¬†<a href="#Lin">[Lin et al., 2020]</a>, it has
become more challenging to keep track of the latest advances in the
field.</p>

<p>Blog posts are becoming an increasingly popular and useful way to talk
about science¬†<a href="#Brow">[Brown and Woolston, 2018]</a>.
They offer substantial value to the scientific community
by providing a flexible platform to foster open, human, and transparent
discussions about new insights or limitations of a scientific
publication. However, because they are not as recognized as standard
scientific publications, only a minority of researchers manage to
maintain an active blog and get visibility for their efforts. Many are
well-established researchers (<a href="https://francisbach.com/">Francis Bach</a>,
<a href="https://www.argmin.net/">Ben Recht</a>, <a href="https://www.inference.vc/">Ferenc
Husz√°r</a>, <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/">Lilian
Weng</a>) or big corporations that
leverage entire teams of graphic designers designer and writers to
polish their blogs (<a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/?page=1">Facebook AI</a>,
<a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/">Google AI</a>,
<a href="https://deepmind.com/blog">DeepMind</a>,
<a href="https://openai.com/blog/">OpenAI</a>). As a result, the incentives for
writing scientific blog posts are largely personal; it is unreasonable
to expect a significant portion of the machine learning community to
contribute to such an initiative when everyone is trying to establish
themselves through publications.</p>

<h3 id="a-blog-post-conference-track">A Blog Post Conference Track</h3>

<p>Our goal is to create a formal call for blog posts at ICLR to
incentivize and reward researchers to review past work and summarize the
outcomes, develop new intuitions, or highlight some shortcomings. A very
influential initiative of this kind happened after the second world war
in France. Because of the lack of up-to-date textbooks, a collective of
mathematicians under the pseudonym Nicolas Bourbaki <a href="#Halm">[Halmos 1957]</a>, decided to start a
series of textbooks¬†about the foundations of mathematics <a href="#Bour">[Bourbaki, 1939]</a>.
In the same vein, we aim at providing a new way to summarize scientific knowledge in
the ML community.</p>

<p>Due to the large diversity of topics that can be discussed in a blog
post, we decided to restrict the range of topics for this call for blog
posts. We identified that the blog posts that would bring to most value
to the community and the conference would be posts that distill and
discuss <em>previously published papers</em>.</p>

<h3 id="a-call-for-blog-posts-discussing-work-previously-published-at-iclr">A call for blog posts discussing work previously published at ICLR</h3>

<p>The format and process for this blog post track is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Write a post about a paper previously published at ICLR, with the
constraint that one cannot write a blog post on work that they have
a conflict of interest with. This implies that one cannot review
their own work, or work originating from their institution or
company. We want to foster productive discussion about <em>ideas</em>, and
prevent posts that intentionally aim to help or hurt individuals or
institutions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blogs will be peer-reviewed (double-blind, see
Section¬†<a href="#sub:sub_process" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sub:sub_process">2.5</a>)
for quality and novelty of the content: clarity and pedagogy of the
exposition, new theoretical or practical insights,
reproduction/extension of experiments, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The posts will be published under a unified template (see
Section¬†<a href="#sub:sub_format" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sub:sub_format">2.4</a>
and
Section¬†<a href="#sub:sub_process" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sub:sub_process">2.5</a>)
and hosted on the conference website or our own Github page.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submissions">Submissions</h2>

<p><strong>Note: The track has concluded and we are not accepting any more submissions!</strong></p>

<p>Our goal is to avoid heavily engineered, professionally-made
blog-posts‚ÄîSuch as the ‚Äú100+ hours‚Äù mentioned as a standard by the <a href="https://distill.pub/journal/">Distill
  guidelines</a>‚Äîto entice ideas and clear writing rather than dynamic
visualizations or embedded javascript engines.</p>

<p>As a result, we restrict submissions to the Markdown format. We believe
this is a good trade-off between complexity and flexibility. Markdown
enables users to easily embed media such as images, gifs, audio, and
video as well as write mathematical equations using MathJax, without
requiring users to know how to create HTML web pages. This (mostly)
static format is also fairly portable; users can download the blog post
without much effort for offline reading or archival purposes. More
importantly, this format can be easily hosted and maintained through
GitHub.</p>

process of creating and submitting a blog post.</p>
